                <h2>Notable Accomplishments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead a project in which my team created a combination of VBA enabled Excel sheets, Javascript powered web pages, and C++ executable programs to automate a workflow process that reduced the time to task completion of a database consolidation effort by 50% which saved the company $80,000+ because the project was completed 6 months ahead of schedule.</li>
                    <li>Created multiple C++ programs and VBA Excel sheets to assist employees with daily database manipulation tasks which reduced time to task completion of said task from multiple hours of work down to 5-10 minutes. This saved the company an estimated $20,000+ annually.</li>
                    <li>Trained 20+ brand new designers on advanced fiber cable design which involved hands-on training, shadowing/reverse shadowing, creation of onboarding documentation, and creation of standardized quick reference documentation. During this time I had to juggle handling high priority design projects of my own as well as onboarding the new hires. Through these efforts we were able to keep up with the reconstruction work needed because of the hurricane damage to the cable network in Louisiana.</li>
